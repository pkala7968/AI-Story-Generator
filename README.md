# AI Story Generator
## Overview

This project is a Django web application integrated with LangChain to generate creative stories and corresponding AI-generated images. The app accepts a user prompt (text or optional audio transcription), generates a short story, detailed character and background descriptions, and produces a combined scene image by merging character and background AI-generated images.
